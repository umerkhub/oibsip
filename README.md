<h3>Iris Flower Classification -</h3>
<hr>
  <strong>&nbsp Iris Flower</strong> has three species: <strong> Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica</strong></h6>, which differs according to their
measurements.
Now assuming that we have the measurements of the Iris flowers according to their species, and here our task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the Iris species and classify them.

  Although the Scikit-learn library provides a dataset for Iris flower classification, you can also download the same dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv">here</a> for the task of Iris flower classification with Machine Learning

  This project is thorough application of machine learning with ```python programming.``` 
It focuses on Iris Flower classification using machine learning and scikit tools. 
Using Logistic Regression Model approach to identify the different species of iris flowers.
At the end of the project we will be able to recognize the  family / species of the flower by just sepal,petal lengths and widths.
